# Merkury

Merkury is a simple command line utility to run Python scripts and render HTML pages with code and produced output.

It's a lightweight alternative to tools such as [jupyter](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter) and [papermill](https://github.com/nteract/papermill). While these have their advantages (and [problems]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U))), when everything you need is to generate a report from a python code run, they might be an overkill. Merkury uses standard `.py` files - any valid Python script that can be run from command line, can also turned into a HTML report.
